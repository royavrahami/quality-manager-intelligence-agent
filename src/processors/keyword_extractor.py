Keyword Extractor – pulls the most meaningful keywords from an article.

Strategy (in order of preference):
  1. If key_insights exist (AI-generated) → parse noun phrases from them
  2. Ask OpenAI for a compact keyword list (when API key is available)
  3. Fallback: fast statistical extraction from title + content
     (stop-word filtering + frequency ranking)
